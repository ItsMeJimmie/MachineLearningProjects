# MachineLearningProjects
This is my repository that holds the different ML projects I've worked on. I will now describe the different projects and what folder they're under.

APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING (FINISHED / NOT UPLOADED YET)

- FINAL PROJECT: This was my final project for my Applied Machine Learning Class that uses a kaggle dataset of diseased and healthy plants where I use an image classifier that will determine if the plant leaf given to the model is diseased or not. This also includes determining the kind of disease.


PREDICT ENERGY CONSUMPTION (IN PROGRESS)

- ENERGY CONSUMPTION: This project is an independent one that I got from a DataCamp article. I did not
use the actual DataCamp data but rather am pulling data from Kaggle. It is a simple Linear Regression type
model that predicts energy consumption on 10 minute intervals. Report in the project explains further in depth
in terms of goals, dataset, etc.

HOUSE PREDICTION AMES (IN PROGRESS)

- AMES HOUSING PREDICTION: This project focuses on using the Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle. It has a focus on using 
Linear Regression, feature engineering and selection, etc. Report in the project folder explains further in terms of
data, goals, etc.
