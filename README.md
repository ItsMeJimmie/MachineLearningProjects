# MachineLearningProjects
This is my repository that holds the different ML projects I've worked on. I will now describe the different projects and what folder they're under.

APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING
	-FINAL PROJECT: This was my final project for my Applied Machine Learning Class that uses a kaggle dataset of diseased and healthy plants where I use an image classifier that will determine if the plant leaf given to the model is diseased or not. This also includes determining the kind of disease.
