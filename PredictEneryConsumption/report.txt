GENERAL DESCRIPTION:

This project comes from Kaggle in the dataset called Electric Power Consumption.
It's primary goal is to use the dataset to produce a Linear Regression model that will be able to
predict with fairly accurate precision energy consumption in the future.

Features:

1.) Date Time: Time window of ten minutes
2.) Temperature: Weather Temperature.
3.) Humidity: Weather Humidity.
4.) Wind Speed: Wind Speed.
5.) General Diffuse Flows: “Diffuse flow” is a catchall term to describe low-temperature (< 0.2° to ~ 100°C) fluids that slowly discharge through sulfide mounds, fractured lava flows, and assemblages of bacterial mats and macrofauna.
6.) Diffuse Flows
